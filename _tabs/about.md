My name is Stephen Maldonado and I am a graduate student at the University of Central Florida pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science.  I have worked in various labs on campus on different projects, particularly those heavy with data.  I am most proficient in Python, however I have experience in Java, C, and Rust.
